# How to Visualize and Interpret a Neural Network
Understanding a neural network with saliency maps and decision trees. This repository includes all source code for the tutorial on DigitalOcean with the same title, including:

- saliency map code, for generating visualizations called Class Activation Maps
- code for running neural network as neural-backed decision tree
- utility to run an ImageNet-pretrained ResNet18 neural network on any image of your choosing
